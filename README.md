# Quick-Ban-Migration

This script allows you to easily and quickly migrate all bans from a discord to another - without any bs of a whole backup software.

## How to use?
1. Clone repo.
2. Run `npm ci` to install dependencies
3. Replace values in `config.json` to actual values 
4. Run `node index.js`
5. Observe. Do not close terminal and read logs carefully for errors.

## Warning
I wrote this in like five minutes for a guy who wanted to pay 5$ for Xenon Premium just to migrate their bans. It works on my machine. I won't offer support for this repo. Use at your own risk.
